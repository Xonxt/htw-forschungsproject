Hand tracking and Gesture recognizing project
=

This is a Research project (Forschungsprojekt) at the **HTW Berlin**. The main task is to recognize short-time gestures in a video.

The project is still underway, so it has performance issues. 

It uses the **OpenCV** framework, which must be installed in order to test/use the code. Get it here: http://opencv.org

The OpenCV version **has to be <u>2.4.X</u>**, because the developers have cut the support for HOG descriptors in the CascadeClassifier in the later versions.

The code was tested on Windows 7 and MacOS 10.8.X.
